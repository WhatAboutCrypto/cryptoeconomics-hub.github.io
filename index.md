<p style="font-size: 1.3em;">We are experiencing one of the most exciting times in history as we now have the opportunity to <b>create a different society</b>. This society will be based on the belief of <b>empowering the individuals</b> to open up an un-considered, un-used and un-valued potential in people and communities.</p>

Cryptoeconomics is one of these important <b>new research fields</b> which combines fundamental principles of game theory and cryptography for <b>managing in an autonomous way the interactions between people or machines</b> hence nodes in the decentralised world.

<hr class="major" />

<p style="font-size: 1.3em;">Cryptoeconomics.hub's purpose is to promote research on cryptoeconomics, <b>make connections between people</b> who share the same passion for the power of incentives and to <b>make knowledge accessible</b> to everyone about the development of the field.</p>

<img class="image left" src="assets/images/logo-ce.hub-trspt-grey-nomargin.png" alt=""/>We organise <b>[Meetups](https://www.meetup.com/cryptoeconomics-hub/)</b> in several formats: regular events and <b>[learning sessions](https://t.me/CEsessions)</b>, both online and in person. You can watch every event we do on <b>[YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCFbR_m4I-40W56jUvJlzfkw)</b>.

Assembling and distributing the knowledge we acquire is one of our topmost mission. You can access our <b>[Cryptoeconomics Reading List](https://github.com/cryptoeconomics-hub/cryptoeconomics-reading-list)</b> where you will find interesting resources to start learning about cryptoeconomics. We also use <b>[Discord](https://discord.gg/G9QbbC)</b> to organise the information. There you will find a vast quantity of resources our community is learning from.

To quickly get in touch with the community and get the latest updates on news, events and stories about cryptoeconomics, you can get in our <b>[Telegram group](https://t.me/cryptoeconomics)</b>.
