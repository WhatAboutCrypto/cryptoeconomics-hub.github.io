Cryptoeconomics.hub's purpose is to promote research on cryptoeconomics, make connections between people who share the same passion for the power of incentives and to make knowledge accessible to everyone about the development of the field.

We organise [Meetups](https://www.meetup.com/cryptoeconomics-hub/) in several formats: regular events and [learning sessions](https://t.me/CEsessions), both online and in person.
