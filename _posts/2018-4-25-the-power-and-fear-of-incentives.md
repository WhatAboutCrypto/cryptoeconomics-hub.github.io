As you may already know, cryptoeconomics is a relatively new field of research that combines relatively old disciplines such as cryptography and game theory to produce different mechanisms to be used within applications. e.g Consensus mechanisms, Auction designs, Token designs. And it is also the way attacks on decentralised systems like blockchains can be planned.

Part One by Sandra, will be about the fundamental layers of cryptoeconomics and how it is already implemented. It should hopefully provide you with all the ingredients the cryptoeconomics theory can play with in order the produce the intended outcomes.

Part Two by Laurent, will place cryptoeconomics in the broader context of social collaboration and cooperation to produce efficient outcomes for the participants of any project. It should hopefully give you a sense of the intentions as well as the tools that mechanism designers are using in their crypto projects.

Token designs and governance are perhaps the two most important applications of cryptoeconomics but still remain unsolved designs to be explored.
