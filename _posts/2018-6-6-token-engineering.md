We had the honour to welcome the Token Engineering expert, Trent McConaghy at our cryptoeconomics.hub in Madrid.

Trent McConaghy did AI research for two decades, including machine creativity and AI to help drive Moore's Law, via two startups (both acquired) and a PhD. Now he focuses on AI * blockchain, via Ocean to democratise AI data, and BigchainDB decentralised database. His hobby is advising governments and startups alike on AI * blockchain. www.trent.st

In his talk, Trent will share learnings in how to go about designing tokenised ecosystems, from their experiences when designing Ocean Protocol. It includes leveraging best practices from designing evolutionary algorithms, categorisation of token building blocks, and an engineering mindset that implies a greater sense of responsibility.
