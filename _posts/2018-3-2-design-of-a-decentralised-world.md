What is so fascinating about Bitcoin? Why is it so difficult to develop PoS? What is the reason for the failure of most ICOs? The answer is Cryptoeconomics. Decentralised autonomous systems only work if we create a design that simultaneously motivates participants, protects against attacks, can survive in a network world and also ensures the highest degree of privacy.

No idea how to do that? Nobody knows that right now, but we know that cryptography, game and mechanism design theories are the main ingredients and there are already some exciting experiments that Sandra Becker would like to present and then discuss with us.
